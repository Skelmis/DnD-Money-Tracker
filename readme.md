DnD Money Tracker
---

I got annoyed at the lack of tooling to track player balances nicely. This solves that.

Built around 5E, this tool automatically takes money and converts it to the highest of each denomination. You can also enable / disable electrum and platinum per person.

Currently, this works off a single counter, sometime in the future I may add per row transactions so you can see how and when players gained money.
